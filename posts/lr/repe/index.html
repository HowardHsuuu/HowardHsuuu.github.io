Title: Representation Engineering: A Top-Down Approach to AI Transparency
Authors: Evan Hubinger, Ajeya Cotra, Buck Shlegeris, Tom Lieberum, Nicholas Joseph, Owain Evans, Nicholas Schiefer, Oliver Zhang, Jan Brauner, Collin Burns, Leo Gao, Ryan Greenblatt

Prior Knowledge

Interpretability in AI: Traditional approaches often focus on low-level features such as neurons or circuits. However, such bottom-up analysis struggles with high-level abstractions like honesty or power-seeking.
Representation Learning: Neural networks form internal embeddings of concepts during training, enabling powerful generalization and emergent behavior.
Mechanistic Interpretability: Aims to reverse-engineer model internals to understand reasoning processes, but often lacks tools for directly modifying internal representations to improve safety.
Transparency and Alignment: Transparency is critical for ensuring model behavior is aligned with human intentions and values, particularly to avoid deceptive alignment and inner misalignment.


Goal
The paper proposes and develops Representation Engineering (RepE), a new top-down framework for interpretability and model control. Rather than focusing on neurons or circuits, RepE centers on representations of high-level cognitive concepts and aims to understand, detect, and manipulate them. The core goal is to advance transparency methods that are directly useful for improving AI safety, including controlling undesirable behaviors like deception or power-seeking."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://HowardHsuuu.github.io/posts/lr/repe/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://HowardHsuuu.github.io/images/icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://HowardHsuuu.github.io/images/icon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://HowardHsuuu.github.io/images/icon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://HowardHsuuu.github.io/images/icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://HowardHsuuu.github.io/images/icon.png><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en-us href=https://HowardHsuuu.github.io/posts/lr/repe/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.4/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-...some_hash... crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.4/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-...some_hash... crossorigin=anonymous></script><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.4/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js integrity=sha384-...some_hash... crossorigin=anonymous></script><script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){renderMathInElement(document.body,{delimiters:[{left:"$$",right:"$$",display:!0},{left:"\\(",right:"\\)",display:!1},{left:"$",right:"$",display:!1}],throwOnError:!1})})</script><meta property="og:title" content="[LR] Representation Engineering: Top-Down AI Transparency"><meta property="og:description" content="[This review is intended solely for my personal learning]

Transparency and Alignment: Transparency is critical for ensuring model behavior is aligned with human intentions and values, particularly to avoid deceptive alignment and inner misalignment. Goal The paper proposes and develops Representation Engineering (RepE), a new top-down framework for interpretability and model control. Rather than focusing on neurons or circuits, RepE centers on representations of high-level cognitive concepts and aims to understand, detect, and manipulate them. The core goal is to advance transparency methods that are directly useful for improving AI safety, including controlling undesirable behaviors like deception or power-seeking.\nMethod RepE consists of two pillars:\nRepresentation Reading: Locating and characterizing emergent representations of high-level concepts or functions (e.g., honesty, power, utility).\nIntroduces Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT), inspired by neuroimaging, which uses designed stimuli to activate internal representations and then fits linear probes. Distinguishes between concept extraction (e.g., emotion, morality) and function activation (e.g., lying, power-seeking), using template-based prompt designs. Representation Control: Actively manipulating representations to induce desired model behavior.\nIntroduces Baseline Transformations, linear modifications in representation space to nudge the model (e.g., toward truthfulness or away from power-seeking). Control methods are unsupervised and avoid requiring ground-truth annotations. Case studies demonstrate applications across:\nHonesty \u0026 Hallucination: RepE can reliably identify and shift the model’s tendency to lie or hallucinate. Power Aversion: Using representational control to reduce power-seeking tendencies. Emotion \u0026 Morality: Locating and modulating responses tied to fairness, anger, or harm. Knowledge Editing \u0026 Memorization: RepE aids in directly editing factual knowledge or mitigating unwanted memorization. Results Improved Transparency: Demonstrates the feasibility of isolating internal representations of abstract concepts like honesty or fairness across various LLMs. Behavioral Control: Using RepE to nudge representations improves performance on safety-critical benchmarks: Achieves +18.1% improvement on TruthfulQA over zero-shot baselines. Outperforms prior honesty-alignment techniques without requiring fine-tuning. Generalization: RepE methods are effective across multiple models and apply to both encoder and decoder architectures. Limitations Linearity Assumption: Most representation operations are linear; further work is needed to handle nonlinear entanglement between concepts. Scalability: Though promising, applying RepE at scale across trillion-parameter models or diverse domains remains computationally challenging. Causal Understanding: RepE identifies and modifies correlates of behaviors, but full causal guarantees (e.g., removing all lies) are not yet ensured. Safety Tradeoffs: The ability to control high-level representations could be dual-use—used to nudge models toward any behavioral target.
