&lt;p>Cognitive and educational psychology have long studied how students learn and retain knowledge, but there remains a gap between research-backed learning strategies and students&amp;rsquo; actual study habits.

This paper seeks to bridge this gap by evaluating ten commonly used learning techniques in terms of their generalizability and efficacy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
